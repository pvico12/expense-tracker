## Contribution Guidelines

### Branching

- **`main`**: The production-ready branch.  
- **`develop`**: The active development branch.  
  - All feature branches should be created from `develop`.  
  - Pull Requests (PRs) must target the `develop` branch.  
  - Changes in `develop` will be tested before being merged into `main` for production deployment.  

### Frontend

TODO: Setup frontend Android project (Kotlin + JetPack Compose)
For more information about setting up your machine for frontend development, please refer to [this file](frontend/README.md).

### Backend

For this application, we are using Python with the Flask framework to build out the API.
For more information about setting up your machine for backend development, please refer to [this file](backend/README.md).

### Database

For this application, we are using a PostGres SQL database.
To set up a database connection from the Flask backend you have 2 options.
1. Local Postgres Database
2. Remote Development Database
For more information on how to set up either of these 2 connections please refer to [this file](backend/README.md).
